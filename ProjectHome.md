# Welcome to the [Python](http://www.python.org) Module for [Oracle Tuxedo](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/tuxedo/tuxedo/index.html) (tuxmodule) Project Homepage #


This module provides access to the Tuxedo [ATMI](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E18050_01/tuxedo/docs11gr1/int/intatm.html) API for the Python programming language.

## Features ##

  * Write Tuxedo clients (both /WS and native) in Python (2.x and 3.2)
  * Write Tuxedo servers
  * Dynamic reload of python code for servers (optional)
  * Support for STRING and FML buffer types. FML buffers are mapped to Python dictionaries with list elements.
  * Full Tuxedo ATMI support (tpcall, tpacall, tpgetrply,  tppost, tpsubscribe, tpnotify, tpsetunsol, tpdequeue, tpenqueue, tpbegin, tpabort, tpcommit, tpsectxt, tpinit, tpadvertise, userlog, tpsetctxt (multithreaded client for Tuxedo > Rel 7))


## Build and Install ##

First, build the module:

  * Check-out or download the source code from the Downloads or Source tab.
  * Set TUXDIR (for example, `export TUXDIR=/opt/bea/tuxedo8.1`)
  * Make sure that you use the desired version of python on the command line
  * Run `python setup.py build --force` to compile the sources
  * Run `python setup.py install` to install in `YOUR_PYTHON_LIB_DIR/site-packages/tuxedo`
  * A package `tuxedo` will be built, with the shared objects atmi.so and atmiws.so in it.

To run the example / test:

  * `cd test`
  * The IPC key is set to 77662 and the WSH port is 7766. Adjust in `ubbconfig` and `setenv` if you need other values.
  * Source setenv (`. ./setenv`) - make sure you still have `TUXDIR` set!
  * Run `make` to build `TUXCONFIG`, `QFS` and the executables for servers and clients.
  * Run `tmboot -y` to start the Tuxedo application.
  * Run `testclient.py` - this will test the ATMI interface.
  * Run `send.py` to test a conversational service.
  * Run `simpcl.py`, the equivalent of `$TUXDIR/apps/simpapp`.
  * Run `tmshutdown  -y` followed by `make clean` when you are done. This also cleans up Tuxedo's IPC resources.


## Usage ##

Remote (/WS) and local client versions of the library will be built.
Use the following for the (local) native client:
```
  from tuxedo.atmi import * 
```

and this one for the (network remote) /WS client:
```
  from tuxedo.atmiws import *
```


### "simpapp" written in Python ###
The Tuxedo installation contains a simple example application, "simpapp".
This is the Python version of that application:

simpcl.py:
```
  import tuxedo.atmi

  print tuxedo.atmi.tpcall("TOUPPER", "Hello World")
```

simpserv.py:
```
  from tuxedo.atmi import *
  import string
  import sys
   
  class server:
     def init(self, arg):
        tpadvertise("TOUPPER")

     def TOUPPER(self, arg):
        userlog("Client-ID = %s" % (self.cltid))
        return string.upper(arg)


  if __name__ == '__main__':
     tuxedo.atmi.mainloop(sys.argv, server(), None)
```


For information on how to use all the ATMI functions that are implemented by the module, have a look at the examples in the `testclient.py` and `pyserver.py`  files in the `test` directory.
